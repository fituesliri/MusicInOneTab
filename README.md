Stack is a web application that visualizes music.
Each egg icon has it's on sound track.

On click the egg plays it's individual sound track and lets the user stack sounds both visually and physically.
Stack also offers a clock so the user can check time while indulging in the creative activiy.

This was my first HTML + Javascript + CSS experience.
There are a lot of points to improve but as a beginner to the languages I tried to keep it simple and understandable.

How to use the app
-Git clone and open HTML.

Or simply access it through this URL

The user can control their experience by tapping the eggs as many time as they want.
Hope you enjoy this experience.
